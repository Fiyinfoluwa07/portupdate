Hi! My name is Esther Alabi and I'm an aspiring software engineer from Lagos. This is a freestyle of my portfolio.

About Me
I'm a student with a passion for building innovative products and solutions. Here are a few highlights:

Frontend Enginner (e.g. JavaScript, React, etc.)
Currently a student at APTECH, chasing a diploma in Software Engineering
Outside of tech, I enjoy Music (e.g. photography, gaming, etc.)
My goal is to build seamless user experiences through intuitive design and clean code. I'm open to freelance or full-time job opportunities. Let's build something great together!
